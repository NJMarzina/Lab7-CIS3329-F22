# Lab7-CIS3329-F22

Lab 7 Instruction
You will write both a client and server – here the client would always be looping as well as the 
server – as it is a chat program. You will use UDP as the transport.
To finish this lab, you need at least three part: (1) A main function (parent thread), (2) A 
receiving function (The first child thread), and (3) A sending function (The second child thread)
